\title{Check if two matrices or their dimensions are broadcastable}
\usage{
is_broadcastable(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A intergerish vector of size 2 representing the dim or matrix}

\item{y}{A intergerish vector of size 2 representing the dim or matrix}
}
\value{
A boolean indicating whether the two arrays are broadcastable
}
\description{
If number of rows(or cols) of one matrix divides the other, then
  the pair is broadcastable
}
\examples{
x = array(1:6, dim = c(2, 3))
y = array(7:9, dim = c(3, 1))

is_broadcastable(x, y)
is_broadcastable(dim(x), dim(y))
is_broadcastable(x, dim(y))
}
